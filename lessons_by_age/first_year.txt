YEAR 1

Just keep em alive and as happy as possible.
Physical contact. Skin to skin.
When they cry, try and anticipate, keep in mind, and or check out, all the little discomforts in life you take for granted (cause you unconsciously fix them for yourself when they happen):
  - The obvious ones: hunger, temperature, position, diaper
  - Less obvious ones: something itchy, something strange, something small poking at them like a tag or some such, something bright, something loud, etc.
