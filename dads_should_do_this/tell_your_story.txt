Tell Your Story Their Whole Life

I started doing this when my daughter was born, just writing a journal directly to her about her at that age but talking to her as if she were already an adult, as I won't give it to her until she is. It's really liberating to talk to your child the way you talk to everyone else in these writings. I don't keep a specific schedule or anything but that could be a helpful way to make sure you do it with enough frequency. Every few weeks or months though, I just decide to add a new entry. I've been tagging each one with date, time, and location so that I will remember easier where I was and what was happening whenever I wrote a specific article. So my entries tend to look something like this...

Hey hey,

So I've been making a new fatherhood repo so I can share all my ridiculous bright ideas with all my friends about how I'm raising you haha. It's really a cool idea though, I think. Could be a really interesting way for me and some of the people I care most about in the world being able to do a better job with you guys. You seem to be really loving our home here and your routine. I hope you grow up to be as happy as an adult as you seem to be as a kid. OK. Gotta go. Talk soon. Love you.

A friend of mine also suggested doing audio or video as an addition or alternative. I say just do whatever format(s) you are most comfortable in so that you can reveal a bit about yourself well at the different ages in your life that your kid will never get to experience firsthand. That's what's so special about this to me. I think think when my daughter gets old enough to be interested in thinking about how she fits into the world and our family she'll love to be able to read these conversations with me at times in her life that she can barely remember.
